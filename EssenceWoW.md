## Summary

The software engineering principles to be used in this project were clearly established in the assignment description. In the initial meeting, the team ensured that we understood every requirement and formalized the conventions to be used in commits, issues and documentation. Although most of us were not particularly experienced in technologies such as Git and GitHub, we worked together to overcome any issues that arose and maintain a structured way of working. At first, the organizational overhead was somewhat difficult to manage, and sometimes felt overcomplicated compared to its benefits. However, once the procedures became more intuitive, they enabled better collaboration between the team by compartmentalizing code and providing useful information on the progress of other members. We have learnt a lot about the software engineering process in the project, though there remains plenty of opportunity for improvement. The next major step may be to reduce reliance on informal channels and establish GitHub as the primary platform for development communication including task updates, code reviews, etc.
